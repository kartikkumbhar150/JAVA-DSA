//Find the level of given node in an Undirected Graph
//Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges and a node X, The task is to find the level of node X in the undirected graph. If X does not exist in the graph then return -1.
//Input: V = 5, Edges = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}}, X = 3
//Output: 2
//Explanation: Starting from vertex 0, at level 0 we have node 0, at level 1 we have nodes 1 and 2 and at level 2 we have nodes 3 and 4. So the answer is 2
